[Enter the procedurally generated dungeons](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/570257841)

Dungeons are generated by procedurally combining tilesets into a map consisting of 4x4 rooms, where all *must* be accessible. This means that all rooms are connected by their entrances and no rooms are spawned such that the player can't enter. There are near infinite combinations of map layouts only limited by the amount of manually created rooms such as the few rooms seen in this picture:

[Collect and equip loot](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/570259567)

Every item in the game has a unique visual appearance on the character while equipped. Items are gained by slaying monsters but in this video loot is exaggerated to view lots of different items on the ground. Each item has its own stats that applies on the character. Each stats that you see in the game will improve your character, eg. a greatsword has higher damage than a dagger, but also has a much slower attack speed.
